Using this [Weather Dashboard](https://timcs1274.github.io/Weather_Dashboard/) is easy! All one needs to do is input the city which they would like to see the weather for and click "search". Your searches will be saved locally and can be easily accessed in the future. You can easily clear this by utilizing the clear history button. 


## Learning Points

This project has been a great culmination of all of the previous tools I have learned. This was the first project that I did which fetched data from a third-party api. Selecting portions of the data, and storing certain peices proved difficult, but I ultimately got it to work. Overall, this project had many learning points and refreshers!
